# README: Outfit Suggester Script

This script interacts with Google Generative AI to provide personalized outfit suggestions based on user input. It generates concise and contextually appropriate outfit recommendations for various body types, style preferences, occasions, and genders.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. **Google Generative AI Library**: Install the `google.generativeai` library:
   ```bash
   pip install google-generativeai
   ```
3. **API Key**: Obtain a valid API key for Google Generative AI and replace the placeholder in the script.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure that the `google-generativeai` library is installed in your Python environment.

2. **Configuration**:
   Replace the placeholder in the script with your actual API key:
   ```python
   genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script using a Python interpreter:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

## How the Script Works

1. **User Input**:
   The script prompts the user to provide the following details:
   - Body type
   - Style preference
   - Occasion
   - Gender

2. **Prompt Generation**:
   The script formats the user input into a structured prompt for the Generative AI model.

3. **Content Generation**:
   Using the `GenerativeModel` class, the script generates a detailed outfit suggestion with:
   - A list of items.
   - A brief description of the purpose and contribution of each item to the outfit.

4. **Output**:
   The generated content is printed to the console for the user.

## Example Workflow

1. User runs the script.
2. Script prompts for input:
   ```
   Please enter your body type: Athletic
   Please enter your style preference: Casual
   Please enter the occasion you want this outfit for: Beach Party
   Please enter your gender (e.g., male, female, non-binary): Male
   ```
3. Output (example):
   ```
   - Lightweight linen shirt: Keeps you cool and stylish in warm weather.
   - Tailored shorts: Comfortable and breathable for a beach setting.
   - Sandals: Ideal for walking on sand while maintaining a casual vibe.
   - Sunglasses: Provides UV protection and adds a touch of flair.
   ```

## Notes

- **API Key Security**: Do not share your API key publicly. Store it securely.
- **Customization**: The script can be modified to include additional input parameters or output formats.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with the library, ensure it is up-to-date:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade google-generativeai
  ```
- Verify that your API key is valid and has sufficient permissions.
